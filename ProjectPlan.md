Stage 1: Proposal

A proposal for a project requires at least three students, with at least one student from each block! (This will require you to utilize GitHub and learn about branches, commits, and pulls.) The proposal must address each of the following:

 General description of the goal or purpose. What are you trying to make happen or solve? Feel free to design projects which utilize content from other courses (simulations, for example), address and analyze real daata and problems (the environment, anyone?), or have other useful impacts.
A game where the player makes choices for the main character in the game, who has just become stranded on an island. The player is shown the amount of resources they have at the beginning (randomly generated). There are obstacles on the island, and you can gain or lose resources as you try to survive the game. If you survive for 2 weeks, the safety boat will arrive.

The player will face many obsticles on the island, such as finding food/water, making shelter, extreme temperatures, being chased by wild animals. These obsticles will be created by different methods in the Island.java class.

Methods include:

every day, you lose five food resources

every day, you lose 3 water resource

every challenge completed you earn a random number of food resources

can get water by playing a guessing game

Temp Method: if random temp is above 110*, and wearing extra layer of clothes, you will lose 10 water resources; if random temp is below 32*, and wearing no exta layers, you will lose 10 water and 10 food resources.

Resource Method: keeps track of all the resources including: food, water clothes, blankets, wood, knife - food and water resources generated by random num ;

( blanket is boolean ; knife is boolean; and wood is boolean ; ) these are updated every 3 days

Finding Food: if survive an obstacle like temp, then add 2 food resources

Finding water: guessing num game in a method

Making shelter: if wood then you make it through the night, else you lose resources

Wild Animals: if have more than 5 food resources player is able to run quickly but they lose all 5 resources, else they die

Class Player: resource method, attributes of player,

Class Game: guessing game method, obstacle methods, keeps track of number of days,

 Anticipated file structure (i.e. what classes will you write, where will the main method exist? Show me that you have thought enough about this problem or project to begin to recognize some of the complexity you will need to account for.
